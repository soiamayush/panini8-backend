"Fifteen integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{15}$ are arranged in order on a number line. The integers are equally spaced and have the property that $1 \leq a_1 \leq 10,13 \leq a_2 \leq 20$, and $241 \leq a_{15} \leq 250$. What is the sum of digits of $a_{14}$ ?","8,9,10,11,12",9,"Fifteen integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{15}$ are arranged in order on a number line.
